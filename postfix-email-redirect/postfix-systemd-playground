# HERE DESCRIPTION
# This systemd service file defines how the Postfix Mail Transport Agent is managed on your system.
# It controls when and how Postfix starts, stops, and restarts, ensuring it only runs when the network is available.
# It can be customized to specify restart behavior, security features (like using a private /tmp directory), 
# and timeout settings to ensure Postfix behaves as desired under systemd.

# instructiON
# 1. To configure this file, place it in /etc/systemd/system/ as 'postfix.service' or adjust an existing file there.
# 2. After editing, run 'sudo systemctl daemon-reload' to apply changes.
# 3. Enable the service to start on boot: 'sudo systemctl enable postfix'.
# 4. Start or stop the service as needed: 'sudo systemctl start postfix' or 'sudo systemctl stop postfix'.
# 5. To monitor the service's status: 'sudo systemctl status postfix'.
# 6. Optional: Uncomment 'Restart=always' and 'RestartSec=60' to enable automatic restarts on failure.
